"""Datacenter topology signal for topology-aware source selection.

A worker reports its RDMA-fabric location as a ``{domain: value}`` map (e.g.
``{"block": "b1", "rack": "r3", "host": "node7"}``), published once at
registration and surfaced on ``SourceInstanceRef.topology``. The
``topology_aware`` selector ranks candidates by the narrowest domain the target
and source share (see ``source_selection.TopologyAwareSelector``).

The representation matches **Grove's** ``ClusterTopology`` CRD
(``clustertopologies.grove.io``), which is the source-of-truth topology hierarchy
Dynamo/Grove expose to workloads. Its ``spec.levels`` is an ordered list (broad
-> narrow) of ``{domain, key}`` entries, where ``domain`` is a platform-agnostic
level from the fixed set below and ``key`` is the node-label key carrying that
domain's value for a node. MX therefore keys its map on the Grove ``domain`` (so
the metadata lines up across the fleet) and takes the value from the node's label
for that domain's ``key``. Both come through the environment, so MX stays
runtime-agnostic and needs no Kubernetes API access from the worker:

- ``MX_P2P_TOPOLOGY_LEVELS``: comma-separated Grove domains, broad -> narrow,
  matching the cluster's ``ClusterTopology`` ``spec.levels`` order, e.g.
  ``"region,zone,datacenter,block,rack,host"``.
- ``MX_P2P_TOPOLOGY``: a JSON object of ``{domain: value}`` for THIS node, e.g.
  ``'{"block":"b1","rack":"r3","host":"node7"}'``. The deploying operator
  populates it from the node's labels using the ``ClusterTopology`` domain->key
  mapping. Missing or unparseable yields ``{}``, so topology-aware selection
  degrades to rendezvous ordering rather than failing.

NVLink is not a level here: MX P2P moves weights between *different* replicas
(different nodes, RDMA transport), so the relevant domains are the inter-node
ones (``rack``/``block`` and above); ``host``/``numa`` matter only for
co-located pairs, which use the NVLink backend NIXL selects automatically.
