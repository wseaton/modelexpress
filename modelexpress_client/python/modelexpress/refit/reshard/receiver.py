"""Engine-agnostic receiver for the no-gather slice-resharding weight refit.

``ReshardReceiver`` owns everything an inference engine needs to pull a resharded
weight update over NIXL that is NOT engine-specific: build this rank's NIXL agent,
discover + P2P-handshake the trainer shards, capture the model's own load
geometry, build the pull plan, allocate + register the receive/staging buffers,
and per refit RDMA the needed slices in + cast dtype-mismatched sources.

The two engine-specific steps are abstract hooks a subclass implements:

  * :meth:`_capture` - run the engine's ``load_weights`` with zero-storage
    placeholders (on a meta twin for a quantized model) to record where each
    source lands, and report the load-time param layout to size the buffers.
  * :meth:`_install` - install the RDMA'd receive buffers into the live params
    (a plain copy for bf16, or re-quantize via the engine's post-load path).

So an sglang / trtllm receiver only implements those two hooks; discover, plan,
transport, buffers and the router dtype-cast are shared here.
