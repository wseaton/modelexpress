"""Slice resolution + intersection.

Turn a ``RecordedCopy`` (which slice of a full source tensor a param needs, and
where it lands) plus the published source shards into the exact byte segments to
RDMA-read per shard. No data moves; the intersection arithmetic (intersect /
paired_runs) is pure index/stride math. Slice RESOLUTION replays the op-chain on
a zero-storage ``meta`` tensor, so ``torch`` is imported lazily - only
``plan_pull`` at plan time needs it; the module and its arithmetic helpers
import (and unit-test) without torch.

Pipeline per copy:

  1. ``resolve_slice`` replays the recorded op-chain on a ``meta`` source to the
     strided view, then derives a per-dim ``[start, stop)`` box in the FULL
     source's index space PLUS the view-dim -> source-dim permutation (so
     transpose/permute slice, not just narrow/getitem), and reindexes the dest
     strides into source-dim order.
  2. ``intersect`` overlaps that needed box with each published shard's box.
  3. ``paired_runs`` walks each overlap into maximal runs that are contiguous in
     BOTH the shard buffer and the destination param, emitting one
     ``PullSegment`` per run.

Two properties worth noting:
  * Destination strides come from the ACTUAL captured ``dest_stride`` (read off
    the real dest view during capture), not a re-assumed row-major layout - a
    non-contiguous destination yields correct finer-grained runs instead of
    silently-wrong bytes.
  * ``__getitem__`` unit-step slices AND transpose/permute/t resolve via the
    meta-tensor replay, not just ``narrow``.

SCOPE: the needed slice must resolve to a permuted axis-aligned box of the source
(narrow/getitem/transpose/permute/t/select/unbind). A copy
(``contiguous``/``reshape`` that materializes), a rank increase, a strided slice,
or a dim-merging reshape - plus src/dst dtype mismatch - raises
``UnsupportedReshard`` and makes the receiver fail closed.
