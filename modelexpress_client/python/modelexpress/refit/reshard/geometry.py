"""Geometry capture.

Capture, per destination parameter, WHICH slice of each full source tensor the
engine's own weight loader reads. We feed zero-storage placeholder tensors
(``LazyWeight``) through the engine's ``model.load_weights`` and record:

  * the view/slice op-chain the loader applied to the source (which slice), and
  * the ``copy_`` destination's ``(offset, shape, stride)`` (where it lands).

No data ever moves here (the ``copy_`` sink is record-only). Downstream,
``slice_plan`` resolves the op-chain to a box of the full tensor and intersects
it with the published shards, and ``plan`` turns overlaps into byte segments to
pull.

Design notes:
  * Framework-neutral: the caller supplies the model (ideally a disposable
    ``meta`` twin) and the framework's default weight-loader; no engine import.
  * Per-source isolation: we bake one source tensor at a time, so unsupported
    geometry is attributed to the specific source before the receiver fails the
    update. It never produces an incorrect partial plan.
  * Allowlist of pure view/slice ops; anything else (arithmetic, .to/.float,
    bool-mask indexing) lands in ``__torch_dispatch__`` and raises
    ``UnsupportedReshard`` for that source, not wrong bytes.
